summary: Pristine is an AI agent that manages issues on a GitHub repository. Its responsibilities include detecting new documentation issues, scoping human-created issues, answering human comments on issues, mapping TODOs in code to issues, closing resolved issues, scanning the codebase for logic flaws, suggesting features or enhancements, ensuring no duplicate issues are created, prioritizing issues, and managing labels. The agent creates small, actionable, and focused issues.
