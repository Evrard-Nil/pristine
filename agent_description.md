### Pristine Agent

The Pristine Agent is an autonomous AI designed to manage GitHub repository issues. It continuously monitors a designated GitHub repository for new events, utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze the context and determine appropriate actions, and then executes those actions on GitHub or its local repository clone. It also offers a web-based dashboard for real-time operational monitoring.

**Key Functions:**

*   **GitHub Issue Management**: Creates, retrieves, updates (title, body), labels (add/remove), comments on, and closes GitHub issues.
*   **Repository Monitoring**: Detects new commits and updates to issues within the configured GitHub repository. It maintains a local clone of the repository, enabling it to list and read file contents.
*   **Intelligent Decision Making**: Integrates with a Large Language Model (LLM) to process contextual information, generate internal thoughts, and decide on a sequence of actions.
*   **Contextual Memory**: Stores and retrieves key-value pair memories to maintain context and continuity across its operations.
*   **Operational Monitoring**: Provides a web-based dashboard to visualize a history of executed actions and LLM calls.

**Inputs:**

*   **Environment Variables**: Configuration details for GitHub App, OpenAI API, and the target repository (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_REPOSITORY_OWNER`).
*   **GitHub Repository Events**: New commits, issues, comments, and updates to existing issues from the monitored repository.
*   **LLM Responses**: Text generated by the configured LLM based on system and user prompts.

**Outputs:**

*   **GitHub Actions (HTTP API)**: Creation, modification, or closure of issues; adding/removing labels; posting comments.
*   **Local Repository Changes (Filesystem)**: Pulls the latest changes to its local clone of the repository.
*   **Internal State**: Updates to its internal memory and operational context.
*   **Monitoring Dashboard (HTTP)**: Real-time logs of actions and LLM calls accessible via a web interface.
*   **Console Output (stdout)**: Logs of its operations and decisions.
