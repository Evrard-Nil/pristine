summary: Pristine is an AI agent designed to manage issues on a GitHub repository. Its primary goal is to maintain the state of issues by creating, updating, and closing them as needed. This includes detecting new documentation issues, scoping human-created issues, responding to comments, mapping TODOs in code to issues, closing resolved issues, identifying logic flaws and testing improvements, suggesting features, and prioritizing issues. The agent also ensures no duplicate issues are created and manages issue labels effectively.
